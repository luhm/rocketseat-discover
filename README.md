<h1>Link-in-Bio - DevLinks</h1>

This is a personal project to create a link-in-bio web application that makes possible to display all important links in only one place. The link-in-bio allows to use only one link on social media profile, specially on instagram and tiktok. This project was proposed during the [Rocketseat's Discover course](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/journey/discover/contents).

This feature was build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The layout and design was made using Figma, and can be modified and adapted to the user’s preferences.
